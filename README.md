# My Portfolio

## Desciption

> This is my developers portfolio to showcase my work and to tell a little about myself for future employers. I was tasked to create a page that I will be able to add my future projects and applications into that will allow potentional employers an insite into what I have created so far. More to be updated in coming months as I complete more projects.
