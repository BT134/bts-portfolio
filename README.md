# My Portfolio - Week 2 Homework

## Desciption

> This is my developers portfolio to showcase my work and to tell a little about myself for future employers. I was tasked to create a page that I will be able to add my future projects and applications into that will allow potentional employers an insite into what I have created so far. The Apps/Projects in the website aren't fully opporational just yet. However they will be updated as I complete projects.
